1.**Supervised learning :**

​	(1)def: It had the right answers, and you wanted the algorithm to just produce more of the same. 

​	(2)**Symbol**

​	$$x^{(i)}​$$  :denote the “input” variables (living area in this example), also called input features;

​	 **$$y^{ (i)}​$$** :denote the “output” or target variable that we are trying to predict (price). 

​	**Training example**:A pair ($$x^{ (i)}$$  , $$ y^{ (i)}$$  ) is called a training example.

​	 **Training set**: the dataset that we’ll be using to learn—a list of m training examples {($$x^{ (i)}​$$  , $$ y^{ (i)} ​$$  );i = 1, . . . , m}—is called a training set. 

​	*Note that the superscript “(i)” in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation.* 

​	We will also use X denote the space of input values, and Y the space of output values. In this example, X = Y = R

​	**h** : X → Y;$$ h_θ(x) = \theta_0 + θ_1 x $$,h(x) is called a **hypothesis**

2.**Unsupervised learning:**

​	(1)def: You're sort of not given the right answer for everything

3.**Reinforcement learning:**

​	(1)def: I think of it as a way for you to specify what you want done, so you have to specify what is a "good dog" and what is a "bad dog" behavior. And then it's up to the learning algorithm to figure out how to maximize the "good dog" reward signals and minimize the "bad dog" punishments. 

4.**Regression problem:**

​	(1)def:Predict real-valued output
